# Visiting NPCs
{: .no_toc}
Visiting NPCs, as the name suggests, visits your island. These NPCs have a visiting schedule dictated by who has appeared the week before, and usually only one visiting NPC will be present on your island at any given day. Some of them will wander your island, and some of them will hang out at the plaza.
